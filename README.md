# JAR Management Script

This script provides functionalities to backup, replace, and restore JAR files in a specified directory. It is designed to handle JAR files used in applications, allowing you to safely back up, replace with a specific JAR, and restore files as needed.

## Features

- **Backup**: Backs up specified JAR files to a designated backup directory.
- **Replace**: Replaces original JAR files with a specified replacement JAR file.
- **Restore**: Restores JAR files from the backup directory to their original locations.
- **Dry Run**: Optionally simulate actions without executing them.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have read and write permissions to the specified directories.
- The replacement JAR file (`reload4j-1.2.19.jar`) should be located at `/root/`.

## Script Variables

- `DIR`: Directory containing the JAR files to be managed.
- `BACKUPDIR`: Directory where backup files will be stored.
- `JAR_FILES`: Array of JAR filenames to be backed up, replaced, and restored.
- `REPLACEMENT_JAR`: Path to the replacement JAR file.
- `DRY_RUN`: Flag to enable or disable dry-run mode (default is `true`).

## Usage

### 1. Backup JAR Files

Back up the specified JAR files to the backup directory.

```bash
./jar_test.sh backup
```

### 2. Replace JAR Files

Replace the original JAR files with the `reload4j-1.2.19.jar`. Ensure the replacement JAR is located at `/root/`.

```bash
./jar_test.sh replace
```

### 3. Restore JAR Files

Restore the JAR files from the backup directory to their original locations.

```bash
./jar_test.sh restore
```

### 4. Dry Run Mode

By default, the script operates in dry-run mode, which simulates actions without executing them. To perform actual actions, disable dry-run mode by using the `-d` option:

```bash
./jar_test.sh -d backup
```

```bash
./jar_test.sh -d replace
```

```bash
./jar_test.sh -d restore
```

## Example

```bash
# Backup JAR files and replace with reload4j
./jar_test.sh backup

# Replace original JAR files with reload4j
./jar_test.sh replace

# Restore JAR files from backup
./jar_test.sh restore
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient permissions for all operations.
- The script will log actions to `/tmp/jar_backup_script.log`.
- The backup directory should be writable and have enough space to store backup files.
